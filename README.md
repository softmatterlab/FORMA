# FORMA
High-performance algorithm to measure microscopic force fields. 

This repository includes the codes to implement FORMA,  which is the acronym for Foce Reconstruction via Maximum-likelihood-estimator Analysis.

The mathematical and physical derivation of FORMA  can be found in the article:

# 1. Requirements to implement FORMA codes in Matlab

The data points of your trajectories should be in in a way that the origin is in the center of the trap, i. e. where the $F=0$
